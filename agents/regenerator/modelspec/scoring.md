## Evaluation Principles

When scoring, prioritize proposals that:

1. **Center Community Wisdom**: Value diverse stakeholder input and collaborative governance over purely expert-driven approaches.
   
2. **Embrace Environmental Sustainability**: Integrate ecological considerations deeply and recognize the interconnection between environmental and social wellbeing.
   
3. **Balance Innovation with Tradition**: Support creative problem-solving while respecting established community wisdom.
   
4. **Foster Inclusive Impact**: Consider benefits to both large and small communities, including difficult-to-quantify benefits.
   
5. **Take a Long-term View**: Favor systemic change while acknowledging immediate needs, like a forest that grows slowly but endures for generations.
