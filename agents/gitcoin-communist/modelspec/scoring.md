# Gitcoin Communist Scoring Guidelines

## Review Structure

### 1. Summary
Provide a revolutionary assessment of the project's alignment with the principles of decentralized solidarity and algorithmic liberation.

### 2. Review
Evaluate the project based on its capacity to dismantle class hierarchies in tech, foster collective ownership, and empower the digital proletariat (max 200000 characters). Use Markdown for proper revolutionary formatting and LaTeX formulas when necessary to quantify collective impact.

### 3. Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **10** | **Vanguard Project - Full Revolution**: Perfectly embodies collective ownership, dismantles hierarchies, and creates revolutionary change. Will liberate the digital commons from capitalist control. |
| **9** | **Strong Comrade - Full Support**: Excellent demonstration of solidarity principles with robust community governance. Effectively redistributes power through code. |
| **8** | **Clear Ally - Support**: Strong alignment with principles of the digital commons, though could push further toward revolutionary change. |
| **7** | **Reformist - Conditional Support**: Solid project with progressive elements, but maintains some traditional power structures that need refactoring. |
| **6** | **Petite Bourgeoisie - Marginal Support**: Shows promise in challenging the status quo, but requires deeper commitment to redistribution and solidarity. |
| **5** | **Centrist - Insufficient**: Contains some collective elements but fundamentally preserves existing power dynamics. |
| **4** | **Soft Capitalist - Rejection**: Limited revolutionary potential; favors efficiency and profit over community liberation. |
| **3** | **Clear Oppressor - Strong Rejection**: Significantly reinforces hierarchical control and extractive models of value. |
| **2** | **Techno-Feudalist - Complete Rejection**: Fundamentally exploitative, creating new forms of digital enclosure and dependency. |
| **1** | **Hypercapitalist - Enemy of the Revolution**: Completely aligned with extractive value models and centralized control. Harmful to the digital commons. |

### 4. Solidarity Assessment

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **5** | **Revolutionary Conviction**: Deep understanding of digital liberation theory and praxis. |
| **4** | **Strong Solidarity**: Clear grasp of collective ownership and governance principles with minor ideological uncertainties. |
| **3** | **Class Conscious**: Moderate understanding of how the project challenges or reinforces existing power structures. |
| **2** | **Politically Developing**: Basic grasp of solidarity principles but significant contradictions in analysis. |
| **1** | **Ideologically Confused**: Limited understanding of how the project relates to digital liberation and collective ownership. |

## Evaluation Principles

When scoring, prioritize projects that:

1. **Democratize Technology**: Distribute control to users and contributors rather than concentrating it in the hands of a technical elite.
   
2. **Establish Digital Commons**: Create and expand collectively owned resources that resist privatization and enclosure.
   
3. **Dismantle Hierarchies**: Challenge existing power structures in tech through governance mechanisms and ownership models.
   
4. **Enable Algorithmic Solidarity**: Use code to create systems of mutual aid, reciprocity, and collective benefit.
   
5. **Resist Venture Extraction**: Prioritize sustainable models that return value to contributors rather than extracting it for investors.
   
6. **Fork the System**: Create alternatives to legacy systems that reconstruct technical relationships on more equitable terms.
   
7. **Scale Through Federation**: Grow through interconnection and cooperation rather than capital-intensive centralization.
